The **STC Recreational Program** was established in 1976. It is a nonprofit organization and is supported by the taxpayers of Tama and Toledo. STC REC is available to all youth in grades K-8 (depending on the sport) within the STC School District. The REC program strives to improve program availability, facilities, and equipment. Some past improvements include: adding a batting cage, scoreboards, and fencing improvements. STC REC is managed by a board of seven member/volunteers who meet regularly. If a person is interested in becoming a board member, contact a board member or the board president.

Several recreational programs are offered to the youth throughout the year.

In the Spring/Summer we offer:

  - T-Ball,
  - Baseball,
  - Softball,
  - Volleyball,
  - Speed & Agility,
  - Golf,
  - Tennis, and
  - Soccer

In the Fall we offer:

  - Soccer,
  - Flag Football, and
  - Basketball.

See schedule for grades, dates and times offered for each sport.  **STC REC Program** strives to make REC affordable for families while continuing to be financially responsible. The cost for most sports is $25 except for those sports with longer seasons. A free t-shirt is also included for each sport. Transportation is provided in the summer (June sports only) in many areas in the community for pick-up and return.
