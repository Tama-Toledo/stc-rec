What you see here was written as a proposal for a couple of new restaurants in town, so it has some food/menu elements, but I think the same could apply to STC Rec.

Simple Brochure Site

Site building fee:  $100
Additional page building:  $25 per page
Hosting fee: $10 monthly or $100 annually.  Includes one content change per month.
Additional content changes: $15 each
Additional graphic design: $25 / hour.  Includes taking and posting photos, logo work, etc.
Register subdomain @ TamaToledo.com (or TamaToledo.net or TamaToledo.org): $20 / year
Custom domain registration: $25 / year plus Registrant fees (these vary by domain)
Register additional subdomains: $5 monthly or $50 annually per subdomain
New features creation: Negotiable @ $25 / hour

These fees assume a simple, 3 or 4-page static site with no customer interaction.  I envision:

A “Landing" page with your logo/brand and critical operating info, contact details, and timely notifications;
A “Menu" page with dishes, including photos if you like, and simple phone-in order instructions;
An “About” page with anything you’d like to share, perhaps including customer testimonials or reviews.

The site would be hosted in my developer cloud at DigitalOcean (https://www.digitalocean.com/).  I’ve been a customer of theirs for about 10 years now.

Let me know if this looks acceptable to you for STC Rec.  If not, we should talk.  If yes, I think we could cover the site for $120/year ($100 hosting fee assuming it's paid annually, plus $20/year for use of stc-rec.tamatoledo.org). 

Thanks and take care.
