It is a nonprofit organization and is supported by the taxpayers of Tama and Toledo. STC REC is available to all youth in grades K-8 (depending on the sport) within the STC School District. The REC program strives to improve program availability, facilities, and equipment. Some past improvements include: adding a batting cage, scoreboards, and fencing improvements. STC REC is managed by a board of seven member/volunteers who meet regularly.</description></item></channel></rss>
